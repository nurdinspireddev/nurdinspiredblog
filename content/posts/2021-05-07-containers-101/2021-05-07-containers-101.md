# Who, What, and Why of Containers

<br/>

# Who

Let's answer this question first... Docker is the _WHO_ in this post.

<br/>

# What

Now let's focus on _WHAT_ a Docker container is and does.

<blockquote class="blockquote">In its most general form, a container is meant to package and isolate a group items and transport them.</blockquote>

For example, a shipping container is meant to organize products, isolate them from other products, protect them, and transport them from a manufacturer's warehouse to some distribution center to end up in the hands of a consumer.

A packaging slip or shipping manifest specifies the details of the container such as where its coming from, where its going, what's inside and other delivery instructions.

Same concept here for software development. A Docker container isolates an application from other applications and resources. The container is given its own instance of a network layer, file system, and resources (CPU, Memory).

A Dockerfile (shipping manifest) follows a standard when setting up an application. The Dockerfile is to required to identify the following:

- application build requirements
- dependencies
- input/ output settings
- etc.

<br/>

```bash
# Sample DockerFile for a .NET Core Build
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

# Copy csproj and restore as distinct layers

COPY \*.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore

# Copy everything else and build

COPY ../myproject/examples ./
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

# Build runtime image

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:3.1
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-env /app/out .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "aspnetapp.dll"]

```

These configurations are used to specify the build requirements and runtime for your application, whether its on your local machine, a server, or scaled across a data center.

# Why

Why bother with containers? We haven't used them before, so why now?

<blockquote class="blockquote">
It runs fine on my machine!
</blockquote>

The whole purpose of containers is to standardize our application builds and execution. The container runtime (explained later) is responsible for the work required to build an application and run it. The Operating System is not using a previously installed Node, .NET, or Python version, the container runtime is utilizing whats listed in the Dockerfile.

The overhead of server maintenance and platform version control has been reduced significantly when using containers. Below is an abstract comparison when hosting applications and the benefit of using containers.

# Methods of Hosting an Application

## Server Application Hosting

Not too long ago and more than likely still used today, physical servers had to be setup to host our applications. Applications require specific libraries in order to run, so specific versions were required to be installed on the server's Operating System. Sharing a server across multiple applications becomes very difficult job when trying to keep these specific version libraries up to date. Versions can vary based on functional compatibility, the time the application was built, bug fixes, etc. This option welcomes the difficulty of leveling the versions across applications or throwing in the towel and setting up a brand new server to host a different platform version.

<br/>

## VM Application Hosting

Virtualization of servers was the next piece of the puzzle to ease this problem. One physical server can host 3-5 virtual servers or more. Now on one box (physical server) we have different running applications with different library versions, installations, what ever the case may be when utilizing virtualization. You have the freedom to setup completely different functioning Operating Systems.

However, the overhead of maintaining 3-5 full operating systems is a headache. Managing updates, security patches, recoverability, scalability, its not a pretty sight.

<br/>

## Container Application Hosting

The next phase in the hosting evolution is the container. The use of a runtime container environment on a single server or physical machine takes out the overhead and headache of managing multiple Operating Systems. This solution lets the applications live in a virtual box/ shell of their own to install their specific libraries and plugins and run on their own environemtn independent of other processes. For the win!
