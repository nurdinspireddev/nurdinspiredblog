# Who, What, Why, and How of Containers

## Who

Let's answer this question first... Docker is the _WHO_ in this post.

## What

Now let's focus on _WHAT_ a Docker container is and does.

In its most general form, a container is meant to package and isolate a group items and transport them. For example, a shipping container is meant to organize products, isolate them from other products, protect them, and transport them from a manufacturer's warehouse to some distribution center to end up in the hands of a consumer. A packaging slip or shipping manifest specifies the details of the container such as where its coming from, where its going, what's inside and other delivery instructions.

Same concept here for development. A Docker container isolates an application from other applications and resources. A Dockerfile (shipping manifest) follows a standard when setting up an application. The Dockerfile to required to identify the following:

- resources (CPU/ Mem)
- application build requirements
- dependencies
- input/ output settings
- etc.

These configurations are used to specify requirements for your application and how to run the application whether its on your local machine, a server, or scaled across a data center.

## Why

Why bother with containers? We haven't used them before, so why now?

### Server Application Hosting

Our choice in a land not that far away, physical servers had to be setup to host our applications. Applications have specific libraries required to run them, so specific versions were required to be installed. Sharing a server across multiple applications is very difficultwhen trying to keep these version specific libraries up to date. Not to mention, expensive if the solution to setup another physical server to host another application.

### VM Application Hosting

Ok, let's forward a few years in advancement and virtualize our servers. Let's have one physical server host 3-5 virtual servers. Cake! Now on one box (physical server) we have different running applications with different library versions, installations, what ever the case may be. This worked for sometime. However, the overhead of maintaining 3-5 full operating systems is a headache. Managing updates, security patches, recoverability, scalability, its not a pretty sight.

### Container Application Hosting

The next phase in the runtime evolution is the container. The jump ahead took out the overhead and headache of the Operating System layer. Let the applications live in a box/ shell of their own to install their specific libraries and plugins and run on their own on a single physical or virtual single operating system.

## How

Hands on experience is how we answer this question. Let's walk through a working example of setting up a <code class="language-bash">.NET Core WEBAPI</code> project running in Docker.
